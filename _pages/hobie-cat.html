<p>In the past 4 decades, more people have taken to the water on a Hobie than any other sailboat design.
  <ul>
    <li>Hobie’s <em>rotomolded sailing catamarans</em> (<strong>Bravo, Wave, T2, Getaway</strong>) are super durable yet performance-oriented. There’s a model for every skill level.</li>
    <li>Hobie’s <em>fiberglass beach-launchable catamarans</em> (<strong>Hobie 16, Wild Cats</strong>) revolutionized sailing. Fly a hull and you’ll understand the global obsession.</li>
    <li>An absolute joy on the water, the <strong>Hobie Mirage Adventure Island</strong> and <strong>Island Tandem</strong> are super easy to rig and sail, and very approachable to people new to sailing.</li>
  </ul>
  If you're interested in a new boat, give us a call to discuss the possibility of a package deal of a new Hobie boat + other related accessories and services.
